# Data-dependent initialization of convolutional neural networks

Created by Philipp Krähenbühl.

### Introduction

This code implements the initialization presented in our [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06856), which is under submission at ICLR 2016.

*This is a reimplementation and currently work in progress. Use at your own risk.*
